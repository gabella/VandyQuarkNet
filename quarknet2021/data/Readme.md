# Data for the workshop

## GWOSC GWTC-2 data
This is a table of publicly announced binary black hole mergers (and others?) from LIGO-Virgo gravitational wave collaboration.  See page
https://www.gw-openscience.org/eventapi/html/GWTC-2/ 
grabbed all three formats (CSV, ASCII, JSON) on 20210619.

## Speed-of-"light" Experiment
There are some longer data sets started after our Tuesday speed-of-light experiment day.  The processed files, the muspeed.csv or similar, are<br> 
**muspeed_shelves3_3214.csv** is with the scintillators on the wire shelves in the 9th floor, spaced 80", with order (from top) 3-2 (gap) 1-4.<br>
**muspeed_shelves4_1234.csv** is with order "normal", from top, 1-2 (gap) 3-4.<br>
Associated Equip files are **EQUIP_22JUN2021_132717.txt** and **EQUIP_23JUN2021_134405.txt** .

## Muons vs Floors in Vanderbilt Stevenson Center
The data from Friday morning moving a CRMD set in telescope mode on a cart.<br>
We setup about 283.5" from the South edge of the service elevator.  Our telescope was 12-gap-34 with a 1 to 3 spacing of 34.5" (top to top).  Using "ST 2 5" for 5 minute updates on the scalars.<br>

* 9th Floor, EQUIP_25JUN2021_101257.txt<br>
* 7th Floor, EQUIP_25JUN2021_104253.txt<br> 
* 5th Floor, EQUIP_25JUN2021_105727.txt<br>
* 3th Floor, EQUIP_25JUN2021_111150.txt<br>
* 1th Floor, EQUIP_25JUN2021_112659.txt<br>

Had a little spill returning the car to the 9th floor.  So took another set of data (one power line pulled out of the PDU).<br>
* 9th Floor, EQUIP_25JUN2021_114413.txt<br>
* 9th Floor w/ GPS, EQUIP_25JUN2021_115733.txt and created muspeed_25JUN2021_115733.csv for ease of counting or timing of hits.<br>
