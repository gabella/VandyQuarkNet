# Muon Lifetime
Motivated by Kazuo Tanaka and his group and his Colab notebook<br>

[Date 20210719] Also the data here is a run with the detectors in vertical, telescope orientation, space 2 (gap) 1 (larger gap) 3-4,  spacing is <br>
* top 2 to top 1, 26.5 in, 0.673 m<br>
* top 1 to top 4, 57.0 in, 1.448 m<br>
* total &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  83.5 in, 2.121 m<br>

And the gate was set to 9600 ns (9.6 us) with a pipeline delay of 40 ns, and two-fold coincidence.  Rough muon lifetime is 2.1 us, so want the
total gate to be many times that.  Coincidence rate was approximately 10 Hz.
