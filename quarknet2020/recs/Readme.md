# Recordings made with the Zoom app.
Too large to upload to GitHub (25 MB limit) so put 0n our old Vanderbilt server

My system is not configured for web playing of the \*.mp4 files, so I have to 
download them and then watch them.

Well, this is why you have a production staff when you do video.  Kind of hit and 
miss with the effort, here is what is there:<br>
**Monday** Forgot to record Gabella.  Other seem fine.<br>
**Tuesday** All three recordings seem fine.<br>
**Wednesday**  Darnit! Did record, but the no useful video (was not picking up the
main cameras).<br>
**Thursday** Recorded the last 1:17:00 (one hour plus).<br>
**Friday**  Seem to have run afoul of the breakout rooms, two large gaps (when we 
moved to the rooms) at 0:24:00 to 1:19:00 no recording, and 2:21:00 2:37:00 no 
video.<br>
