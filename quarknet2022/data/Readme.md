# Data files

Collection of data files for the usual experiments, including looking at PMT signals with a scope.<br>
<br>
**PMT Pulse**<br>
Using the Tecscope in a mode collecting many "frames" each with 500 points per record, and saved to a thumb drive as a CSV file.  During the workshop the scope failed but have data files from earlier in the week.<br>
<br>
**Zdecay**<br>
Using the PDFs of 2D tracks that a protractor can be used to figure out the px, py, pz, and with the E, and equivalent mass of what decayed can be found.  Using iSpy you can read off 3D momenta and energy to make the 4-vector and calculate the original mass.<br>
<br>
**bouncing ball**<br>
We filmed with our cell phones a bouncing superball and analyzed them with Tracker video analysis code.  Looking for gravitational acceleration.<br>
<br>
**sn6165**<br>
For speed-of-muons, we used the s/n 6165 detector in the back of the room with scintillators in the 12-gap-34 order (normal) and then the 34-gap-12 order (swapped).<br>
<br>
**Muon lifetime**<br>
Collect the un-biased (no coincident) data and let eLab do all the hard work.<br>
