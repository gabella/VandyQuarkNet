# Muon Lifetime
<br>
Set the detectors up with no. 3, gap, then no. 1, gap and then no. 34, or similar.  Use no coincidence, let eLab or Python notebook do that hard work.
With a lot of data, and setting it up to cover 10 microseconds (lifetime ~2.1 us), you can get a good plot, and can ask eLab for the fit too.<br>
