  Tried to compile and cannot with
gfortran -std=legacy -ohits hitsmp.f hitsaux.f fakehbk.f
and not without the -std switch.

hitsBill 1 <equip file>
does seem to work still.

  Did compile the code with new gfortran, but commented out the
line around hitsmp.f line 212, the read(bufin...)iba.  The ida
variable seems not to be used for anything.  Maybe in shower mode.

c        write(6,*)'**',bufin(1:10)  ! Debug, was commented out, beg.
c        read(bufin(3:nchar),*)iba  ! This read ignores ^M, BEG commented this out.  Not used.
c        write(6,*)iba  ! beg 6-output, 5-input
        ncount(15)=ncount(15)+1
        read (2,1000,err=900,end=901)bufin
